A production-ready, **100% zero-cost-tier** conversational AI advisory and financial structuring platform designed to bridge the formal credit gap for hyper-local business owners and rural micro-entrepreneurs across India.

The platform operates natively on **Telegram** and **Meta WhatsApp Cloud API** (supporting spoken voice notes and text in **Kannada, Hindi, Telugu, Marathi, and English**). It deterministically structures subsidized government credit schemes, validates financial feasibility against **NABARD unit-cost benchmarks**, compiles bank-ready **Detailed Project Report (DPR)** PDFs with 5-year cash-flow and DSCR projections, and provides State Channelizing Agency (SCA) field officers with a real-time geo-verification and loan sanction console.

## 📊 Real-Data Governance & Migration Status

The project is actively executing the **Real-Data Migration** from synthetic/mock baselines to authoritative Government of India and NABARD publications. The current state is strictly documented below:

### Status Breakdown

## 🎯 Executive Overview

### The Rural Credit Problem
Rural micro-entrepreneurs (such as kirana store owners, dairy farmers, tailors, rural artisans, and small traders) face severe structural barriers when seeking formal credit:
1. **Financial Illiteracy & Documentation Hurdles**: Bankable Detailed Project Reports (DPRs), Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) calculations, and 5-year cash-flow statements are typically prepared by expensive chartered accountants or brokers who exploit applicants.
2. **Language Barriers**: Official banking portals and national loan schemes (PMEGP, MUDRA, Stand-Up India) are predominantly in complex English or formal Hindi, alienating vernacular speakers in states like Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Maharashtra.
3. **Exploitative Informal Debt**: Unable to navigate formal banking documentation, rural traders frequently resort to local money-lenders charging extortionate interest rates ($36\% - 60\%$ p.a.).
4. **SCA Verification Delays**: State Channelizing Agencies (SCAs) lack digitized, geo-tagged field-inspection pipelines to verify margin money and physical premises quickly.

### The AI Advisory Solution
The **Rural Micro-Enterprise AI Advisory Platform** provides an end-to-end, zero-barrier bridge directly inside ubiquitous messaging applications (**Telegram** and **WhatsApp**):
- **Zero Typing Barrier**: Accepts natural spoken voice notes in native regional dialects and text.
- **Zero Preassumption Consultation**: The AI never guesses missing financial details; it conversationally asks targeted clarification questions for the trade, district, and project budget.
- **Strict Mathematical Accuracy**: Concessional loan structures, margin money, subsidies, and EMIs are calculated by a deterministic Python engine, completely eliminating LLM financial hallucination.
- **Bank-Concurring DPR Generation**: Instantly compiles and delivers an official 2-page DPR PDF with unit costs grounded in authentic NABARD parameters.
- **Government Concessional Loan Structuring**: Seamlessly evaluates State Channelizing Agency schemes (MFS at $6.5\%$ and TLS at $8.0\%$), PMEGP $35\%$ capital subsidies, and MUDRA collateral-free loans.
- **End-to-End Field Audit**: Feeds sanctioned proposals directly into a geo-enabled Streamlit inspector console for field officers.

### Key Platform Capabilities
- 🌐 **5 Supported Languages**: Full native dialogue, voice STT, TTS, advisory, and DPR generation in **English, Hindi (हिंदी), Kannada (ಕನ್ನಡ), Telugu (తెలుగు), and Marathi (मराठी)**.
- 🔘 **Interactive Telegram Keyboard**: Custom button menu on start allowing instant language selection (`1. English`, `2. हिंदी`, `3. ಕನ್ನಡ`, `4. తెలుగు`, `5. मराठी`).
- 🎙️ **Voice In & Voice Out**: Spoken voice notes are transcribed with automated language synchronization, and replies include spoken voice synthesis.
- 🧮 **Deterministic Precision**: Strict enforcement of loan caps, statutory thresholds, reducing-balance amortizations, and DSCR viability.
- 📄 **Direct File Delivery**: Zero-tunnel, in-chat delivery of bankable PDFs directly to the user's phone.
- 📍 **Field Officer Console**: Streamlit dashboard featuring GPS coordinate recording, margin money verification, and one-click sanctioning.

## 🔬 Technical Approach & Core Methodologies

### 1. Deterministic Financial Math vs. Probabilistic LLM
Generative Large Language Models are probabilistic and prone to mathematical inaccuracies, loan-cap drift, and hallucinated repayment schedules. In this platform:
- **LLMs never perform math.**
- Every lending parameter (loan amount, required beneficiary margin, interest rate, repayment tenure, moratorium, monthly EMI, and DSCR) is computed in pure Python with floating-point verification.
- The pre-computed numbers are injected into structured prompt variables. The LLM is instructed via strict system constraints to quote the numbers verbatim.

### 2. Multilingual Script Disambiguation & Language Selection
Supporting 5 Indian languages requires robust Unicode analysis:
- **Telegram Interactive Keyboard**: When the user sends `/start` or `reset`, the bot displays an interactive keyboard (`1. English`, `2. हिंदी`, `3. ಕನ್ನಡ`, `4. తెలుగు`, `5. मराठी`).
- **Kannada Script Block** (`0x0C80`–`0x0CFF`): Distinct Unicode script mapped to Kannada.
- **Telugu Script Block** (`0x0C00`–`0x0C7F`): Distinct Unicode script mapped to Telugu.
- **Devanagari Disambiguation (Hindi vs. Marathi)**: Both languages share the Devanagari Unicode block (`0x0900`–`0x097F`). The system uses a two-tier disambiguation pipeline:
  1. *Character-Level Check*: Presence of the Marathi consonant **`ळ`** (`U+0933`) immediately classifies the text as Marathi.
  2. *Lexical Marker Scoring*: Matches words against curated sets of distinctive lexical markers (`MARATHI_DISTINCT_WORDS` e.g., आहे, नाही, माझे, मला, करायचे vs. `HINDI_DISTINCT_WORDS` e.g., है, नहीं, मेरा, मुझे, करना).
- **Latin Alphabet Density**: Text containing Latin characters with no Indic script characters is automatically classified as English.

### 3. Grounded Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
To prevent unrealistic loan proposals, proposals are grounded in authentic **NABARD (National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development)** unit-cost benchmarks:
- **Embeddings**: Utilizes FastEmbed (`bge-small-en-v1.5`), generating 384-dimensional dense vectors on the CPU with zero external API latency.
- **Vector DB**: Qdrant Cloud collection (`nabard_benchmarks`) indexed with Cosine Similarity.
- **Payload Data**: Real-world unit capital expenditures (CAPEX), operating expenses (OPEX), and minimum required DSCR for rural trades (dairy, tailoring, poultry, grocery, flour mills, fisheries, etc.).

### 4. Zero-Tunnel Polling Runner with Singleton Lock
During local development and testing, webhook tunnels (such as ngrok or localtunnel) frequently disconnect, expire, or introduce latency.
- **Singleton Socket Lock (`127.0.0.1:49153`)**: Binds a dedicated local socket before polling Telegram. If a previous instance is detected, it terminates the stale process automatically via PID lookup and acquires the lock, guaranteeing that only **one polling instance** ever runs against the Telegram Bot API token.

### 5. Dual-Engine DPR PDF Generation & Direct Stream Delivery
Generating bank-compliant PDF documents in resource-constrained environments:
- **ReportLab Native Engine**: Zero-dependency, pure Python PDF canvas builder that compiles official 2-page DPR documents in sub-second time.
- **WeasyPrint HTML/CSS Engine**: Secondary template-driven pipeline for complex typography and printable styling.
- **Direct Stream Delivery**: PDFs are sent as raw in-memory bytes directly via Telegram's multipart `sendDocument` API, ensuring the entrepreneur receives the report even if external cloud object storage is offline.

## 💰 Financial Lending Rules & Schemes

### Statutory Lending Tier Comparison

| Parameter | Tier 1: Micro Finance Scheme (MFS) | Tier 2: Term Loan Scheme (TLS) |
|---|---|---|
| **Target Entrepreneurs** | Hyper-local micro-enterprises & village artisans | Small commercial ventures & scaling agro-units |
| **Project Outlay Range** | Up to **₹1,40,000** | **₹1,40,001 to ₹50,00,000** |
| **Statutory Loan Cap** | Capped at **₹1,25,000** ($90\%$ of cost) | Capped at **₹45,00,000** ($90\%$ of cost) |
| **Minimum Beneficiary Margin** | Minimum $10\%$ (dynamically absorbs excess) | Minimum $10\%$ (dynamically absorbs excess) |
| **Concessional Interest Rate** | **6.50% p.a.** (Reducing balance) | **8.00% p.a.** (Reducing balance) |
| **Total Loan Tenure** | 36 Months | 84 Months |
| **Moratorium Period** | 3 Months | 6 Months |
| **Repayment Installments** | 33 Monthly Installments | 78 Monthly Installments (or 26 Quarterly) |
| **Eligible Example Trades** | Tailoring unit, Kirana stall, 2-Cow Dairy | Commercial Dairy, Poultry Farm, Fertilizer Depot |

### The ₹1,40,000 Statutory Boundary Edge Case
A common statutory boundary error in lending platforms occurs at exactly `₹1,40,000`:
- Naive mathematical calculation: $90\% \times ₹1,40,000 = ₹1,26,000$.
- However, the State Channelizing Agency statutory guideline strictly caps Tier 1 (MFS) at **₹1,25,000**.
- **Dynamic Absorption**: The engine caps the loan at **₹1,25,000** and dynamically increases the required beneficiary margin to **₹15,000** ($10.71\%$), rather than $10\%$ ($₹14,000$), ensuring the project outlay is fully financed without violating government lending limits.
- Validated under automated testing in `tests/test_finance_calculator.py`.

### Mathematical Formulations (EMI, Cash Flows & DSCR)

#### 1. Monthly Equated Monthly Installment (EMI)
Calculated using standard reducing-balance actuarial amortization:
$$EMI = \frac{P \times r \times (1+r)^n}{(1+r)^n - 1}$$
Where:
- $P$ = Net Sanctioned Principal Loan Amount
- $r$ = Monthly interest rate $\left(\frac{\text{Annual Rate}}{12 \times 100}\right)$
- $n$ = Active repayment installments after moratorium (33 for MFS, 78 for TLS)

#### 2. Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)
Banks require a minimum average DSCR of $\ge 1.50$ to sanction micro-enterprise loans:
$$DSCR = \frac{\text{Net Operating Income} + \text{Depreciation}}{\text{Total Debt Service (Principal Repayment} + \text{Interest Paid)}}$$

#### 3. 5-Year Cash Flow Projection Model
- **Year 1**: 70% Operating Capacity Utilization (accounting for setup & market ramp-up)
- **Year 2**: 80% Capacity Utilization
- **Year 3**: 90% Capacity Utilization
- **Year 4**: 95% Capacity Utilization
- **Year 5**: 100% Full Capacity Utilization

## 🛡️ Reliability, Security & Production Readiness

1. **Zero Financial Hallucination**: Financial rules are strictly deterministic. Loan caps, interest amortizations, and DSCR metrics are calculated by Python logic and quoted verbatim.
2. **Webhook Idempotency**: Meta WhatsApp and Telegram webhooks record message IDs in a transactional database table. Duplicate webhooks are ignored, preventing double-processing.
3. **HMAC-SHA256 Request Verification**: Meta WhatsApp inbound payloads are authenticated using the app secret signature header (`X-Hub-Signature-256`).
4. **Singleton Port Concurrency Protection**: Local Telegram polling is guarded by a system socket bind on `127.0.0.1:49153` to prevent duplicate processes from receiving updates.
5. **Direct Channel Delivery Resilience**: The platform delivers generated PDFs directly as multipart file bytes to the chat, removing external cloud storage as a single point of failure.
